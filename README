HERE BE DRAGONS!

WarpDrive is under development, lacks documentation, and has no real world trackrecord.
You have been warned:-)


WarpDrive is a Maven plugin with an accompanying J2EE taglib and servlet-filter. Together they can
help optimize your site and make it display more quickly by employing well-known techniques such as
far-future expires headers, smart script placement, content minification and more.
It aims to by easy to use and non-intrusive during development.

WarpDrive was inspired by the UI Performance plugin for the Grails framework.
